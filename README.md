# Sass-Boilerplate

## Introduction

  This boilerplate is for a basic scaffold and with mixins for a [SASS][sass] project together with the [Compass][compass] framework.

  Sass-Boilerplate combines the CSS philosophies of [OOCSS][oocss] – "Object Oriented CSS" and the hierachy of [SMACSS][smacss] – "Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS"

  This isn't a general solution or recommendation how to setup your Sass project. This is __my__ own solution for it.


## Setup

    git clone git@github.com:cange/sass-boilerplate.git
    mv sass-boilerplate your_project_name
    gem install bundler
    bundle install
