// Base Rules
//
// A Base rule is applied to an element using an element selector, a
// descendent selector, or a child selector, along with any pseudo-classes.
// It doesnâ€™t include any class or ID selectors. It is defining the default
// styling for how that element should look in all occurrences on the page.

// Like these
body, form
  margin: 0
  padding: 0

a
  color: #039
  &:hover
    color: #03f
